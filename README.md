## Project Description

A Cab Booking Console Application

I was tasked with creating an Cab Booking system for a small company/group. This program will allow employees to book a cab. When manager approve/deny the request they can optionally leave a message. An employee can login to request a Cab. Respective department Managers can view these requests and approve or deny them. Admin can view all booking details and assign a cab to them when manager accepted the request. Also admin can add,update and delete a cab as well as employees data.
